# SLU05 - Python Flow Control (Week 3)

Welcome to **Week 3** of the Prep Course!

By the end of this unit, you'll have mastered how to write **smarter, more flexible programs** using:
- `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements
- `while` and `for` loops
- Boolean algebra and operator precedence
- List and dictionary comprehensions

These are **core building blocks** of programming logic â€” think of them as your mental toolkit for solving real-world problems with code.

## What You'll Learn

| Concept | Covered In |
|--------|-------------|
| Writing conditions with `if`, `elif`, `else` | Learning Notebook 1 |
| Boolean logic and operator precedence | Learning Notebook 1 |
| `while` loops and `for` loops | Learning Notebook 2 |
| Nested loops, loop control, infinite loop handling | Learning Notebook 2 |
| List and dictionary comprehensions | Learning Notebook 3 |
| Real-world practice with flow control | Practice and Exercise Notebooks |

## Learning Notebooks

These are your guided resources to **learn** each topic:
- `Learning Notebook 1`: Conditions & Boolean logic
- `Learning Notebook 2`: Iteration (loops)
- `Learning Notebook 3`: Comprehensions

Take your time with these, and make sure to run the code examples. They're designed to help you **build intuition** step-by-step.

## ðŸ’ª Practice & Exercise Notebooks

Time to put your learning into action!
### `Exercise Notebook 0`: Get started  
Let's practice those basic skills.

### `Exercise Notebook 1`: Planet X - Flow Control Challenges  
Practice turning real-world scenarios into Python logic using conditions and loops.

### `Exercise Notebook 2`: Game X - A Full Challenge  
Test your flow control skills with a story-based challenge where you'll help futuristic candidates pass tests and win a prize!

## Tips for Success

- Break problems down into small steps in **plain English** before writing code.
- If you hit an infinite loop:  
  â†’ Use **Kernel â†’ Interrupt** or the **Stop** button in Jupyter.
- Use `print()` to debug â€” it's your best friend!
- Stuck? Use the built-in `hints` function or ask questions on the forum!
